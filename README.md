# GoTrash
Senior Design Project (GoTrash)
We are developing a trash reporting system called GoTrash. This web app would assist in keeping the environment clean especially in polluted areas. Each person generates on average 1 kilogram of waste per day; that's enough waste to fill 285,000 trucks. If we were to put them in a row, the line would go from New York to London. Part of it gets recycled but a huge amount of trash ends up in illegal dumps. These dumps are everywhere - in our cities, nature, rivers, and oceans. The first step in cleaning up the world is knowing where all the “dirty spots” are that is where our app helps. People can report on the map where there is a trash dump, once it is cleaned, they mark it up in the app as “clean”. Organizations, schools, and various other facilities can utilize our app to help the community and volunteer as community service. Environmental organizations, municipalities, or active citizens in the area will be notified. You too can choose to receive these notifications.
